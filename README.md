Project Details
Lipinski's Rule of Five
Lipinski's Rule of Five is applied to evaluate the drug-likeness of compounds based on:

Molecular weight
LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient)
Hydrogen bond donors
Hydrogen bond acceptors
This rule is important for determining whether a compound has properties suitable for oral bioavailability.

pIC50 Conversion
IC50 values are converted to pIC50 values using the formula: 
pIC50
=
−
log
⁡

(
IC50
)
pIC50=−log

 (IC50)

This transformation is essential for machine learning models to predict biological activity on a consistent scale.

Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning models are used for prediction:

Logistic Regression: A linear model used for classification tasks.
DecisionTreeClassifier: A model that uses a decision tree to make decisions based on features.
RandomForestClassifier: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric model that classifies data based on the proximity of neighbors.
LazyRegressor: A regression model that applies a variety of models with minimal parameter tuning.
Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
Precision: The proportion of true positive instances among all instances predicted as positive.
Recall: The proportion of true positive instances among all actual positive instances.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
The best-performing model is selected based on these evaluation metrics.

Results and Conclusion
In this project, the RandomForestClassifier performed the best in predicting the activity of the Mu Opioid Receptor based on the evaluation metrics. This model provides the most accurate predictions, and its feature importance can be used to identify the key factors affecting the receptor's activity.
